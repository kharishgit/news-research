News Research Assistant
A web application to scrape, store, and query news articles using Streamlit, LangChain, Pinecone, and OpenAI. The app scrapes news from BBC and CNN, stores articles in a Pinecone vector store, and allows users to ask questions about current events.
Features

News Scraping: Automatically fetches articles from BBC and CNN via cron jobs.
Vector Storage: Stores articles in Pinecone for efficient retrieval.
Query System: Uses LangChain and OpenAI to answer user questions about news events.
Streamlit UI: Interactive web app with pages for querying, viewing top-rated articles, and more.

Prerequisites

Python 3.10+
Anaconda or virtualenv
API keys for:
OpenAI (for embeddings and LLM)
Pinecone (for vector storage)



Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-research-assistant.git
cd news-research-assistant


Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:Using Anaconda:
conda create -n newsresearch python=3.10
conda activate newsresearch

Or using virtualenv:
python -m venv newsresearch
source newsresearch/bin/activate  # On Windows: newsresearch\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file or export the following:
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export PINECONE_API_KEY="your-pinecone-api-key"
export PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT="us-east1-gcp"  # Replace with your Pinecone environment


Download NLTK Data:
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"


Set Up Pinecone Index:

Log in to Pinecone.
Create an index named news-research-assistant (dimension: 1536, metric: cosine).


Run the App Locally:
streamlit run Home.py

Access the app at http://localhost:8501.


Usage

Scrape News:

Run refresh_news.py manually or set up a cron job to scrape BBC and CNN articles:python refresh_news.py


Articles are saved to bbc_news.json, cnn_news.json, and all_news.json.


Query News:

Open the Streamlit app.
On the home page, enter a question (e.g., "Whatâ€™s happening with the Pehalgam attack?").
View results and top-rated articles on the respective pages.



Deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud

Push to GitHub:

Ensure all files (Home.py, pages/, requirements.txt, etc.) are in your repo.
Push to a public GitHub repository.


Deploy:

Sign up at streamlit.io/cloud.
Link your GitHub repo and select Home.py as the main file.
Set environment variables in Streamlit Cloud (under "Advanced Settings"):OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-pinecone-api-key
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east1-gcp


Deploy the app. Access it at yourappname.streamlit.app.



Project Structure

Home.py: Main Streamlit app for querying news.
pages/: Additional Streamlit pages (e.g., 3_Top_Rated.py for top-rated articles).
refresh_news.py: Script to scrape news and update Pinecone.
scrape_bbc.py, scrape_cnn.py: Scripts for scraping specific sites.
vector_store.py: Handles Pinecone vector storage.
cron.log: Logs for cron job runs.

Known Issues

LangChain deprecation warnings: Plan to migrate to LangGraph for agent functionality.
API costs: Monitor OpenAI/Pinecone usage to avoid unexpected charges.

Future Improvements

Add caching to reduce API calls.
Expand news sources (e.g., Reuters, AP).
Improve UI with better layout and error handling.
